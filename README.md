# JamDeno Developer

Welcome to the JamDeno Developer GitHub Profile page! My name is Andrew Weisbeck and I am the owner of the JamDeno Digital Studio - this GitHub account is used solely for the JamDeno Digital Studio Repositories as the Admin. My main GitHub username is [GeauxWeisbeck4](https://github.com/geauxweisbeck4) - you can add me and I'll follow you back!

Lets get into a little bit more about me and this organization.

## More About the Studio

The JamDeno Digital Studio is a brand new organization that is essentially taking the place of Tar Heel Dev Studio - I wanted something a little more Next-Gen and software sounding than Tar Heel. That is pretty much the whole reason behind the change. I will miss the Tar Heel Dev Studio logo, but that brand is not going away. It just will be used differently as Tar Heel Java Dev and Tar Heel Dev Sports Studio. 

I hope to have a logo and more information soon - until then, stay tuned!
